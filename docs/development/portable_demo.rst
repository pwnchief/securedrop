Portable SecureDrop Demo
========================

When at a conference or traveling, it is possible to prepare a
SecureDrop demo using portable hardware and adapted usage scenarios.

Hardware
--------

* A laptop running the :doc:`staging virtual environment <virtual_environments>`
* A Tails compatible laptop with a physical radio kill switch (for
  instance a Lenovo T420)
* Four USB keys prepared for the staging environment running on the laptop

  * Transfer
  * Journalist
  * SVS

The Tails compatible laptop has the physical radio kill switch turned
off to simulate a SVS and it is rebooted with the physical radio kill
switch turned on to simulate the Admin or Journalist workstation.
